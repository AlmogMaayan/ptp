name: ptp-deploy
description: Use this skill when the user wants to ship / deploy / release the current feature branch — commit all changes, push, open a PR, merge to master, delete the merged branch, run the project's deploy (CI/CD) action, autonomously fix conflicts/CI/deploy failures within a bounded retry budget, and finally return to a clean master. The one ptp step that deliberately commits, pushes, and merges. Never self-approves a PR (GitHub forbids it); stops for a human approval only when branch protection requires one. Drives /ptp:deploy and /ptp:deploy-pr-approved.

# ptp-deploy — the terminal "ship it" pipeline

## Purpose

This skill is the **terminal step of the ptp pipeline**: it takes the work already applied
and reviewed on the current feature branch and lands it in production. It is the single ptp
step that deliberately **commits, pushes, and merges** — the documented exception to ptp's
otherwise-absolute "never auto-commit / never auto-push" invariant, the same way `/ptp:master`
is the documented exception to `ptp-branch-guard`. Where the rest of ptp stops short of git
history, this skill owns it end to end and then returns to a clean base branch.

Two commands share this skill, differing only in **start phase**:

- `/ptp:deploy` → start phase **`commit`** (the full pipeline).
- `/ptp:deploy-pr-approved` → start phase **`merge`** (assumes the branch is pushed, a PR
  exists, and — for the required-approval case — a human approval is now present).

## The approval reality (read this — there is no approval config knob)

GitHub **blocks a PR author from approving their own PR** — a hard rule, with no setting,
admin toggle, or API override. Approval therefore matters **only as a merge gate**, and only
when branch protection **requires** an approving review:

- **No required approval (solo repos / no protection):** the merge proceeds with no approval.
  This skill runs straight to production.
- **A required approval that isn't met:** the merge is blocked until a *different* identity
  approves. This skill **cannot** satisfy that itself (it authored the PR), so it **stops at
  the PR** and hands off to `/ptp:deploy-pr-approved`.

Consequences, enforced below: **never run `gh pr review --approve`** (it fails as the author
and is pointless), and **never `--admin`-bypass a required approval** (that gate is a
deliberate human checkpoint). The gate is **detected** from the PR's `reviewDecision`, not
configured.

## Configuration (read first, before any write)

Read and merge the optional ptp config (global `~/.claude/ptp/config.json`, then project
`<repo>/.claude/ptp/config.json` overriding key-by-key — the same files `codex.mode` uses).
Extract the `deploy` block; apply defaults for any missing file/key/invalid value (never fail
to start over a config typo):

| Key | Default | Use |
|-----|---------|-----|
| `mergeMethod` | `"squash"` | `gh pr merge --<method>`. |
| `maxFixRounds` | `3` | Cap for both fix loops (each bounded independently). |
| `workflow` | `null` | Explicit deploy workflow file; else auto-detect. |
| `inputs` | `{}` | `workflow_dispatch` inputs for the deploy workflow. |

There is no approval/auto-approve key of any kind — see *The approval reality* above.

## Branch safety — special case (the inverse of ptp-master)

This skill does **not** run `ptp-branch-guard` to cut a branch for its own work, and it is
**not** read-only. It is a documented special case: it operates on the **already-cut feature
branch** and *requires* one — it refuses to run on the base branch (`master`/`main`), because
there is nothing to deploy from there. Its internal deploy-fix sub-flow (step 8) *does* cut
`ptp/deploy-fix-*` branches and merges them through the same PR mini-flow, so a fix is
**never** committed to the base branch directly. The exemption (and its opposite-direction
rationale to `/ptp:master`) is recorded in the `ptp-branch-guard` skill's "Which steps run the
guard" section as the single source of truth.

## Preconditions (read-only; abort before any write)

Evaluate all of these before the first git write. A failure here STOPs the command and writes
nothing:

1. **`gh` CLI present and authenticated** — run `gh --version` and `gh auth status`. If `gh`
   is missing or not logged in → STOP with install/`gh auth login` guidance.
2. **Inside a git repository** — `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`. If not → STOP.
3. **HEAD is a feature branch, not the base branch** — `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. If
   it is `master`/`main` → STOP: "nothing to deploy — you are on the base branch. Run
   `/ptp:deploy` from the feature branch that holds the change." (See *Branch safety* above.)

The `/ptp:deploy-pr-approved` entry adds one more precondition before its `merge` start phase:
an open PR exists for the branch (`gh pr view --json url,state,reviewDecision`) and either its
`reviewDecision` is `APPROVED` or the merge is otherwise no longer blocked. If a required
approval is still missing → STOP and tell the user to get it approved first.

## The pipeline

### Phase `commit` (start of `/ptp:deploy`)

**Step 1 — derive the message.** Build a Conventional-Commit subject + body from the branch's
openspec change(s): inspect `openspec/changes/<id>/` for the change ids present on this branch
(prefer the branch name `ptp/<change-id>` / `ptp/epic-XXXX`, falling back to changed paths
under `openspec/changes/`). Use the change's `proposal.md` title/summary for the body and list
the change id(s). If no openspec change is discoverable, fall back to a concise
diff-summary Conventional-Commit (e.g. `feat: <branch summary>`). Never prompt the user.

**Step 2 — commit & push.** `git add -A`; if there is anything staged, `git commit` with the
derived message; then `git push -u origin HEAD`. If the tree is already clean (nothing to
commit), skip the commit and still ensure the branch is pushed/up to date.

### Phase `pr`

**Step 3 — PR.** If an open PR already exists for the branch (`gh pr view --json url,state`),
reuse it. Otherwise `gh pr create --base <default-branch> --head <branch>` with the derived
title and a body that links the openspec change(s). Capture the PR number/URL.

### Phase `fix` (PR-stage)

**Step 4 — bounded PR-stage fix loop (≤ `maxFixRounds`).** Make the PR mergeable and green.
Loop up to `maxFixRounds`:
- **Mergeability** — `gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`. If conflicting, merge the
  base branch into the feature branch (`git fetch origin && git merge origin/<base>`), resolve
  conflicts (delegate substantial resolution to a fix subagent via the Agent tool), commit,
  `git push`.
- **Checks** — `gh pr checks <pr>`. For any failing required check, fetch its log
  (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`), fix the cause inline (delegate substantial fixes to a
  subagent), commit, `git push`.
- Re-evaluate. When conflicts are gone and required checks pass, exit the loop. On exhausting
  the cap, **STOP** and report the outstanding conflicts/failures — never loop unbounded, never
  merge over red checks.

### Phase `merge`

When entered via `/ptp:deploy-pr-approved` (which starts here), first re-run the PR-stage fix
loop (step 4) if the PR is no longer mergeable or a required check regressed while waiting for
approval — then proceed to the gate below. (On the straight-through `/ptp:deploy` path, step 4
already ran immediately before this.)

**Step 5 — approval gate (detected; never self-approve).** Read `gh pr view --json
reviewDecision,mergeStateStatus`:
- `reviewDecision` is `REVIEW_REQUIRED` or `CHANGES_REQUESTED` → branch protection requires an
  approving review that isn't met. **STOP**: print the PR URL and instruct: "This repo requires
  an approving review. Have a *different* collaborator approve the PR (you cannot approve your
  own), then run `/ptp:deploy-pr-approved`." **Never** run `gh pr review --approve`; **never**
  `--admin`-bypass.
- `reviewDecision` is `APPROVED`, or empty/null (no review required) → proceed to merge.

**Step 6 — merge.** `gh pr merge <pr> --<mergeMethod> --delete-branch`. This squash-merges (per
`mergeMethod`) to the base branch and deletes the merged remote branch. If the merge fails
because an approval is required (a gate not caught at step 5), STOP and hand off to
`/ptp:deploy-pr-approved` exactly as in step 5 — do not retry with `--admin`. Other merge
failures → report.

### Phase `deploy`

**Step 7 — run the deploy action.** Resolve the deploy workflow:
- If `deploy.workflow` is set, use it.
- Else auto-detect: scan `.github/workflows/*.yml` for a workflow whose name/file matches
  `deploy` / `release` / `publish` (prefer an exact `deploy.yml`).
If a workflow is found and it declares `workflow_dispatch`, dispatch it:
`gh workflow run <wf> [-f key=value …]` using `deploy.inputs`. If it is not dispatchable,
identify the run the merge push triggered on the base branch instead. Either way,
`gh run watch <run-id>` (or poll `gh run list --workflow <wf>`) to completion and capture the
conclusion. **No deploy workflow found** → report "no deploy action detected; skipping deploy"
and continue to step 9.

### Phase `deploy-fix`

**Step 8 — bounded deploy-stage fix loop (≤ `maxFixRounds`).** If the deploy run concludes
`failure`, the fix cannot be committed to the base branch directly (invariant). Instead:
1. Cut `ptp/deploy-fix-<short-id>` from the up-to-date base branch.
2. Diagnose from the failed run log and apply the fix (delegate substantial fixes to a subagent).
3. Run the **commit → PR → merge mini-flow** (steps 2–6) for the fix branch.
4. Re-dispatch the deploy (step 7) and re-watch.
Loop up to `maxFixRounds`. On exhaustion, **STOP** and report the failing deploy run + logs.

### Phase `land`

**Step 9 — return to clean master.** Invoke the **`ptp-master`** skill (its clean-tree gate →
`git switch <base>` → `git pull --ff-only`). Report the final state: PR merged (URL), branch
deleted, deploy run conclusion, and the now-current clean base branch.

## Start-phase routing

| Command | Enters at | Skips |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| `/ptp:deploy` | Phase `commit` (step 1) | nothing |
| `/ptp:deploy-pr-approved` | Phase `merge` (step 5) | commit/push/create — but re-verifies the PR exists, the branch is pushed, and any required approval is now present, then re-runs the PR-stage fix loop (step 4) if checks regressed before merging |

`/ptp:deploy-pr-approved` is only needed when `/ptp:deploy` stopped at step 5 because the repo
**required** an approving review. For repos with no required approval, `/ptp:deploy` already
ran straight through to production.

## Terminal report

Always end with a clear status: each phase's outcome, the PR URL + merge result, the deploy run
id + conclusion, how many fix rounds each loop used (and whether a cap was hit), and the final
branch. On any STOP, state exactly what blocked and the single next action.

## Hard rules

- **This is the one ptp step that commits, pushes, and merges.** That is by design and is
  documented here and in `ptp-branch-guard`. No other ptp command may auto-commit.
- **Never run on the base branch (`master`/`main`).** Deploy requires a feature branch; on the
  base branch it STOPs (the inverse of `/ptp:master`).
- **Never self-approve.** Never run `gh pr review --approve` — GitHub forbids approving your own
  PR and the author always is the author. A required, unmet approval STOPs the command and hands
  off to `/ptp:deploy-pr-approved`.
- **Never `--admin`-bypass a required approval.** A required approving review is a deliberate
  human checkpoint, not something to force past.
- **Never commit a fix directly to the base branch.** Deploy-failure fixes go through a
  `ptp/deploy-fix-*` branch and the PR mini-flow.
- **Both fix loops are bounded** by `maxFixRounds` (default 3) and independently capped. On
  exhaustion, STOP and report — never loop unbounded, never merge over red checks.
- **Squash by default** (`mergeMethod`), and always `--delete-branch` on a successful merge.
- **Deploy degrades gracefully**: no detectable deploy workflow → report and skip, do not error.
- **Config typos never crash** — every `deploy` key falls back to its default.
- **End by invoking `ptp-master`** to land on a clean base branch; do not hand-roll the switch.
